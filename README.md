# ENPM818M-final-project
Implementing an HTTP Server for my final project for ENPM818M: Introduction to Networking and Distributed Systems 5G/6G.

The HTTP Server will be built using C++

## Project Requirements

1. HTTP Server can handle requests from an HTTP Client and returns a 200 response.
2. HTTP Server can route HTTP Client requests to certain endpoints and return endpoint specific information.
3. HTTP Server can handle GET requests and return server information.
4. HTTP Server can handle POST requests by updating  a “database” file on the server side.
5. HTTP Server can handle PUT requests by updating  a “database” file on the server side.
6. HTTP Server can handle DELETE requests by updating  a “database” file on the server side.
7. HTTP Server can handle different headers sent in the HTTP Client request.
